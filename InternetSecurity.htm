<h2 align="center">Differences between passive and active security threats</h2>
<p align="left"><font color="black" face="italic" size="5">Although both active and passive attacks are a part of security attacks, if you compare active and passive attacks, both of them have a lot of differences between them. The main differences between them are made based on how they are done and how much damage they do to the system and its resources. Difference between active and passive attacks in network security are listed down below:
In active attacks, modification of messages is done, but on the other hand, in passive attacks, the information remains unchanged.
The active attack causes damage to the integrity and availability of the system, but passive attacks cause damage to data confidentiality. 
In active attacks, attention is given to detection, while in the other one, attention is given to prevention. 
The resources can be changed in active attacks, but passive attacks have no impact on the resources.
The active attack influences the system services, but the information or data is acquired in passive attacks.
Inactive attacks, information is gathered through passive attacks to attack the system, while passive attacks are achieved by collecting confidential information such as private chats and passwords. 
Active attacks are challenging to be prohibited, but passive attacks are easy to prevent.</font></p>

<h2 align="center">Malware</h2>
<p align="left"><font color="black" face="italic" size="5">It is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network (by contrast, software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency is typically described as a software bug). A wide variety of malware types exist, including computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wiper and scareware.
Programs are also considered malware if they secretly act against the interests of the computer user. For example, at one point Sony music Compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers' computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying, but which also reported on users' listening habits, and unintentionally created extra security vulnerabilities.
A range of antivirus software, firewalls and other strategies are used to help protect against the introduction of malware, to help detect it if it is already present, and to recover from malware-associated malicious activity and attacks.</font></p>

<h2 align="center">Software and hardware to protect networks</h2>
<p align="left"><font color="black" face="italic" size="5">Firewalls are hardware appliances and software programs that act as a barrier between incoming traffic and the network. The firewall compares data packets that are sent over the network to predefined policies and rules that indicate whether or not the data should be permitted into the network.</font></p>

<h2 align="center">Network protocols</h2>
<p align="left"><font color="black" face="italic" size="5">-Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a popular communication protocol which is used for communicating over a network. It divides any message into series of packets that are sent from source to destination and there it gets reassembled at the destination.<br>
-Internet Protocol (IP): IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used with TCP. The IP addresses in packets help in routing them through different nodes in a network until it reaches the destination system. TCP/IP is the most popular protocol connecting the networks.<br>
-User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a substitute communication protocol to Transmission Control Protocol implemented primarily for creating loss-tolerating and low-latency linking between different applications.<br>
-Post office Protocol (POP): POP3 is designed for receiving incoming E-mails.<br>
-Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is designed to send and distribute outgoing E-Mail.<br>
-File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP allows users to transfer files from one machine to another. Types of files may include program files, multimedia files, text files, and documents, etc.<br>
-Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is designed for transferring a hypertext among two or more systems. HTML tags are used for creating links. These links may be in any form like text or images. HTTP is designed on Client-server principles which allow a client system for establishing a connection with the server machine for making a request. The server acknowledges the request initiated by the client and responds accordingly.<br>
-Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): HTTPS is abbreviated as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure is a standard protocol to secure the communication among two computers one using the browser and other fetching data from web server. HTTP is used for transferring data between the client browser (request) and the web server (response) in the hypertext format, same in case of HTTPS except that the transferring of data is done in an encrypted format. So it can be said that https thwart hackers from interpretation or modification of data throughout the transfer of packets.<br>
-Telnet: Telnet is a set of rules designed for connecting one system with another. The connecting process here is termed as remote login. The system which requests for connection is the local computer, and the system which accepts the connection is the remote computer.<br>
-Gopher: Gopher is a collection of rules implemented for searching, retrieving as well as displaying documents from isolated sites. Gopher also works on the client/server principle.<br>

<h2 align="center">Digital certificates and certificate authorities</h2>
<p align="left"><font color="black" face="italic" size="5">Digital certificates are issued by trusted parties, called certificate authorities, to verify the identity of an entity, such as a client or server.<br>
The digital certificate serves two purposes: it verifies the owner's identity and it makes the owner's public key available. It is issued with an expiration date, after which it is no longer guaranteed by the certificate authority (CA).<br>
To obtain a digital certificate, you send a request to the CA of your choice, such as Verisign, or RSA. The request includes your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature. A distinguished name (DN) is a unique identifier for each user or host for which you are applying for a certificate. The CA checks your signature using your public key and performs some level of verification of your identity (this varies with different CAs). After verification, the CA sends you a signed digital certificate that contains your distinguished name, your public key, the CA's distinguished name, and the signature of the certificate authority. You store this signed certificate in your key database.</font></p>
