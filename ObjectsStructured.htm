<p align="left"><font color="black" face="italic" size="5">-Object-oriented: This type of programming language includes some objects and classes. A class is like a template and it defines some behaviors. Objects are the members of this template that have those defined behaviors. So, this shows us that all of these objects are related to each other. In the example below, all of the three cars are a member of the class “car”. This means that they all have features and behaviors of a car but they also might have other features that vary them from each other.<br>
  -Structured: This type of programming is based on some instructions and functions. So this type of languages are devides into some functions. A function is a named section of a program that performs a specific task. PHP is one of these programming languages.</font></p>
